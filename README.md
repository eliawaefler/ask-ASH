Usage
Here's how to use the model in your project:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your-huggingface-model-identifier"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

def predict(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        logits = model(**inputs).logits
    predicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()
    return model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]

# Example usage
text = "Your example text here"
print(predict(text))
